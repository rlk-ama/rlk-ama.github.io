            <strong><em>perform doc</em></strong> proudly presents their first event, hosted by Manifesta HQ as part of the house exhibition of Ellen de Bruijne Projects, <em>Terrestrial Records</em>. The evening will start by an introduction to <strong><em>perform doc</em></strong>, followed by a performance by Feiko Beckers and a scripted performance by Dora García.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-2">
            Performances by Feiko Beckers, which he prefers to call "workshops", present personal stories. You might recognize yourself and learn how to live with the confusing feelings which can arise from these situations. In <em>A disappointment you can rely on</em>, Feiko reverses our usual understanding of the notion of disappointment as something that one can also place unconditional trust in. Feiko Beckers teaches the audience cooking techniques which are guaranteed to fail.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-5">
            A scripted performance by Dora Garcia will be shown as well. Where the presence of Feiko Beckers himself is necessary for his performances, the scripted performance <em>The Synthome Score</em> by Garcia can be performed by anyone. The score of the performance is based on an "unofficial" English translation of Jacques Lacan's seminar 23 <em>Le Sinthome</em> (1975-1976), a series of ten lectures that drew from the writings of James Joyce to elaborate on language, the unconscious, and a reconsideration of the Borromean knot. Garcia’s work is accompanied by ten sets of movements, one for each of the ten lectures. Two performers determine the rhythm, cadence, and speed of the performance. Garcia’s score and choreographic notation welcome new participants, accidental stutters of the body, or slips of the tongue. It is left to the visitor to decide if, how, and when to enter the conversation.The performance was shown at the Venice Biennale 2015, running continuously during the opening hours.
